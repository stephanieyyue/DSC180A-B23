Although many drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) with different modes of action 
are employed in clinical settings, the wearing-off phenomenon occurs frequently 
in the advanced stages of the disease; thus, more therapeutic options are 
required. Our clinical observations have found that the oral administration of 
codeine phosphate ameliorated wearing-off in two cases of PD. Case 1 was a woman 
in her 60s. One day, she had a common cold and took an antitussive, expectorant 
drug, Aneton, an over-the-counter medicine. After taking it, not only were her 
common cold symptoms ameliorated but her akinesia also improved. Among the 
ingredients of Aneton, codeine phosphate proved to be effective for her 
akinesia. Case 2 was a man in his 50s with PD accompanied by severe, 
intermittent pain. Codeine phosphate prescribed for his pain improved both his 
pain and bradykinesia. The oral administration of codeine phosphate ameliorated 
akinesia/bradykinesia in both cases of PD. This suggests the possible efficacy 
of codeine phosphate against motor symptoms in PD. In the future, a 
well-designed multicenter trial is needed to assess the use of codeine phosphate 
for PD patients, particularly to evaluate its efficacy for motor symptoms, its 
adverse effects, and its long-term prognosis in patients with PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with growing 
evidence suggests peripheral immunity plays a role in its pathogenesis. However, 
the specific peripheral immune cell types and gene expression profiles 
associated with PD remain unclear. In this study, we integrated single-cell 
expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) data from 14 immune cell types in 
the OneK1K cohort with large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for 
PD. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization analyses, we 
identified 28 immune-cell-specific eGenes with significant associations to PD 
risk, among which 24 showed strong or moderate evidence of shared genetic 
signals. Notable candidates included FDFT1, ARSA, CTSB, and HLA-DQA1, each 
displaying cell-type-specific associations in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B 
cells, and monocytes. Replication using an independent sc-eQTL dataset from the 
DICE project confirmed consistent findings for several eGenes. Additional 
validation through peripheral blood single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
revealed distinct expression patterns and significant changes in PD patients. 
Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) showed multiple associations with 
immune-related traits and minimal associations with unrelated traits, indicating 
a favorable safety profile for therapeutic targeting. Drug repurposing analysis 
identified several candidate compounds, including felodipine, amodiaquine, 
alprazolam, and tetrandrine, some of which are predicted to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. Molecular docking simulations further supported strong 
binding interactions between these compounds and PD-associated targets such as 
CTSB and ARSA. This integrative approach highlights key immune-cell-specific 
genes involved in PD and proposes several repurposable drugs with central 
nervous system potential, paving the way for more targeted therapeutic 
strategies.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and pathological 
aggregation of a-synuclein. Despite advancements in symptomatic treatment, there 
is a critical unmet need for disease-modifying therapies capable of halting or 
slowing disease progression. Drug repurposing offers an efficient, 
cost-effective strategy to identify new treatments by leveraging the established 
safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of existing compounds. Dimethyl fumarate 
(DMF), an FDA-approved drug for multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, has recently 
emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent in PD research. Preclinical studies 
consistently demonstrate that DMF exerts beneficial effects in both in vitro and 
in vivo PD models, primarily via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Through this mechanism, DMF counters 
oxidative stress, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes mitochondrial quality 
control, and impedes pathological protein aggregation. These biological effects 
translate into the preservation of dopaminergic neurons and improvements in 
motor behavior in animal models. Although direct clinical evidence of DMF's 
efficacy in PD patients is currently very limited, early mechanistic human 
studies provide indirect support for the targeting of the Nrf2 pathway in PD. 
Furthermore, DMF's neuroprotective properties extend to other neurodegenerative 
diseases, underscoring its broader therapeutic potential. In conclusion, the 
strong preclinical foundation, combined with an established clinical safety 
record, makes DMF an attractive candidate for repurposing as a disease-modifying 
therapy for PD. Future clinical trials will be essential to validate these 
preclinical promises and define DMF's role in the management of PD.

BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have been reported to 
exhibit therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing their 
potential for drug repurposing. One aspect of PD pathogenesis is thought to be 
associated with the gut-brain axis, where α-synuclein from the gut is 
transmitted to the brain via the vagus nerve (VN).
OBJECTIVE: We explored whether sitagliptin, a DPP-4i, exhibits a protective 
effect in a low-dose rotenone-treated gut-brain axis-associated PD model.
DESIGN: To explore the effect of sitagliptin, we used the oral rotenone-treated 
mouse model, which showed spreading of pathological α-synuclein from the 
intestine in a stereotypic manner via the VN into the midbrain with motor 
deficits.
RESULTS: Sitagliptin mitigated rotenone-induced gut inflammation and toll-like 
receptor 2 (TLR2) expression, reduced α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, VN 
and brain and lessened neuronal loss in the medulla and midbrain with recovery 
of motor performance. In addition, sitagliptin suppressed inflammation in 
response to a TLR2 agonist and rotenone in macrophages, enteric glial cells and 
enteroendocrine cell lines in vitro. In secretin tumour cell 1, an 
enteroendocrine cell line, sitagliptin also decreased rotenone-induced 
endogenous α-synuclein levels. The beneficial effects of sitagliptin were 
maintained even under glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor blockade. Notably, 
sitagliptin significantly altered the gut microbiome, shifting towards a profile 
that may counteract PD pathology.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that sitagliptin alleviated α-synuclein 
deposition in the gut and brain through modulation of TLR2-mediated inflammation 
and altered the gut microbiome composition towards a more favourable profile, 
which indicates that DPP-4is can offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing 
PD.

INTRODUCTION: Butrin, a flavonoid glycoside derived from Butea monosperma, has 
garnered attention for its neuroprotective effects attributed to its 
multifaceted pharmacological profile. It modulates dopamine and norepinephrine 
levels and exhibits antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and mitochondrial-protective 
actions. These properties position butrin as a promising candidate for 
therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease. This review consolidates mechanistic insights, 
preclinical evidence, and therapeutic perspectives of butrin to assess its 
potential clinical applicability in managing neurodegenerative disorders.
METHODS: This review critically analyzes existing preclinical studies on the 
neuroprotective effects of butrin. Emphasis is placed on its mechanisms of 
action, including mitigation of oxidative stress, suppression of 
neuroinflammation, enhancement of neurotrophic factors, and preservation of 
mitochondrial integrity. Additionally, the review explores current limitations 
in clinical translation and evaluates emerging drug delivery strategies aimed at 
improving its therapeutic potential.
RESULTS: Preclinical evidence indicates that butrin effectively counters 
excitotoxicity and protein aggregation, key pathological features of 
neurodegenerative disorders. It attenuates neuropathological processes and 
demonstrates synergistic effects when combined with other neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory agents. Nonetheless, its poor bioavailability and limited 
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier remain significant barriers to clinical 
application.
DISCUSSION: Despite its promising pharmacological profile, the clinical 
translation of butrin is constrained by absorption challenges and suboptimal 
pharmacokinetics. Innovative strategies, such as nanocarrier-based delivery 
systems, drug repurposing, and combination therapies, may enhance its 
therapeutic efficacy. Addressing these limitations is crucial for advancing 
butrin from bench to bedside.
CONCLUSION: Butrin exhibits compelling neuroprotective properties supported by 
robust preclinical data. However, large-scale clinical trials are essential to 
validate its efficacy. Integrating advanced drug delivery systems and 
personalized medicine approaches may unlock its full potential in managing 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Real-world evidence on the potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) for dementia and Parkinson's Disease (PD) is crucial. This observational 
study aimed to evaluate TKIs, particularly nilotinib and imatinib, as potential 
therapeutic agents for these conditions.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 5,579 cancer patients who were 
prescribed TKIs (users; ≥ 40 years) within 5 years were used, while propensity 
score-matched patients without any record of TKIs (never users) served as the 
reference. An association of TKIs with dementia and PD was assessed by the 
Fine-Gray Model with adjusted-competitive hazard ratios (aCHRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs): [aCHRs (95% CIs; p-value)].
RESULTS: The risk of dementia decreased when all types of TKIs [0.65 (0.48-0.88; 
<0.01)], imatinib [0.66 (0.48-0.89; <0.01)], and nilotinib [0.46 (0.23-0.93; 
<0.05)] was used in cancer patients. Additionally, the reduced risk of PD was 
identified in users of all [0.56 (0.33-0.97; <0.05)] and imatinib [0.55 
(0.32-0.96; <0.05)]. When the risk was evaluated according to the number of 
times for total usage, the aCHRs for PD in the low, middle, and high-frequency 
groups were 0.46 (0.20-1.02), 0.78 (0.40-1.54), and 0.40 (0.15-1.05), 
respectively. The risk of dementia was 0.68 (0.46-0.99), 0.57 (0.36-0.90), and 
0.71 (0.44-1.17) in order of frequency (from low to high).
CONCLUSION: As an observational study indicated a decreased risk of dementia and 
PD with long-term TKI use, imatinib and nilotinib may serve as potential 
therapeutic agents for these conditions, with more evidence from rigorous 
clinical trials to validate.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated across a spectrum of neurological 
diseases, yet its causal role and mechanistic specificity remain unclear. This 
study employed a multi-modal integrative analysis of mitochondrial gene 
expression in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's Disease (PD) to address these gaps. We 
combined machine learning for predictive modeling with genetic causal inference 
methods (Mendelian Randomization, colocalization, PheWAS), followed by drug 
enrichment analysis and molecular docking. Our machine learning models, 
particularly Support Vector Machine and Multi-layer Perceptron, effectively 
classified these conditions, with MS exhibiting the highest predictability (mean 
Accuracy: 0.758). Causal inference analyses identified specific gene-disease 
links; for instance, genetically predicted increased expression of PDK1 was 
causally associated with an elevated risk for both AD (OR = 1.041) and ALS (OR = 
1.037), identifying pyruvate metabolism as a shared vulnerability. In contrast, 
genes like SLC25A38 emerged as highly predictive specifically for PD. We also 
observed evidence of potential brain-periphery interaction, such as a 
bidirectional causal relationship between red blood cell indices and MS risk. 
Finally, drug enrichment analysis highlighted Celecoxib, and subsequent 
molecular docking predicted a strong binding affinity to PDK1 (docking score S = 
-6.522 kcal/mol), generating hypotheses for potential metabolic modulation. 
Taken together, this study provides a computational hypothesis framework 
suggesting mitochondrial pathways and targets that warrant future biological 
validation. This study provides specific, genetically supported evidence for the 
causal role of mitochondrial pathways in neurological diseases and identifies 
tangible targets for future therapeutic development.

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) plays a regulatory role in controlling the activity 
of monoamine neurotransmitters, especially dopamine. Its overexpression leads to 
a decreased concentration of dopamine in the brain, converts MPTP to MPP + (a 
potential toxin for dopaminergic neurons), and increases hydrogen peroxide and 
ROS levels in gliosis, leading to neurodegeneration. Thus, MAO-B becomes a key 
target enzyme for neurological disabilities such as PD and AD. In this study, we 
used drug repurposing to explore the pool of USFDA-approved and Pharmacopeial 
drugs (3619 drugs) and performed HTVS (high-throughput virtual screening) using 
both ADME parameters with emphasis on their ability to cross the BBB and 
considering the prerequisites of a generated pharmacophore model for MAO-B. The 
fetched 656 ligands were subjected to SP and XP dockings, MMGBSA, and dynamics 
analysis to identify the top 10 leads with maximum plausibility to interact with 
MAO-B. The analysis presented Bazedoxifene and Epicatechin as lead compounds 
with a higher affinity towards MAO-B than MAO-A. The in-silico work was further 
validated using in vitro biological analysis that includes MAO inhibitory 
activity, reversibility studies, and intracellular ROS inhibition studies. 
Epicatechin and bazedoxifene displayed moderate MAO-B inhibitory activities with 
IC50 values of 11.14 ± 0.53 µM and 13.11 ± 0.21 µM, with more than sixfold and 
fourfold selectivity over MAO-A, respectively. Thus, this study can open the 
avenue to the development of Bazedoxifene and Epicatechin as potential 
pharmacophores for the design and development of selective and reversible MAO-B 
inhibitors with higher efficacy for the management of neurological disabilities.

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the 
oxidative deamination of dopamine and other neurotransmitters, contributing to 
neurodegeneration via increased oxidative stress. Elevated MAO-B activity is 
implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
diseases. Although several MAO-B inhibitors are clinically available, their 
therapeutic utility is often limited by poor selectivity, off-target effects, 
and suboptimal pharmacokinetics. Here, we developed an integrated computational 
approach to identify novel, selective MAO-B inhibitors by repurposing 
FDA-approved drugs. Support vector machine (SVM) classification models were 
trained on curated MAO-B bioactivity data using four molecular fingerprints, 
with robust feature selection and cross-validation. The models achieved high 
predictive performance (AUC up to 0.9914, accuracy >96.93 %, MCC > 0.9179) and 
were used to screen FDA-approved drugs. For benchmarking, Random Forest, XGBoost 
and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were also evaluated using the same datasets and 
molecular fingerprints. Although all the three algorithms exhibited strong 
predictive performance (AUC > 0.85), the SVM model consistently outperformed 
them across all key metrics, underscoring its robustness and reliability for 
MAO-B inhibitor prediction. Top-ranked leads were subjected to molecular 
docking, MM-GBSA binding free energy analysis, and extended 200 ns molecular 
dynamics simulations using Amber v.24. Z1541760033 (Irinotecan hydrochloride) 
emerged as the most promising candidate, showing a docking score of 
-11.86 kcal/mol, strong hydrogen bonding with Gly55, Gln204 and Tyr186, π-π 
stacking with Tyr433, and a favorable MM-GBSA ΔG_total of -98.3 ± 0.19 kcal/mol. 
MD analysis confirmed stable conformational behavior and persistent active-site 
engagement. Additional candidates, including Z1546610486, also displayed 
favorable interaction profiles and dynamic stability. Leveraging chemically 
diverse training data and extended MD simulations, our pipeline prioritizes drug 
candidates with high predicted affinity and dynamic stability. This study 
highlights the power of combining machine learning classification with atomistic 
simulations for drug repurposing and provides a set of promising lead compounds 
for further experimental validation as MAO-B inhibitors targeting 
neurodegenerative diseases.

An increasing amount of evidence shows that type I interferon response, which is 
induced by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase 
(cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is closely associated with 
health and neuroinflammatory diseases. Abnormal activation or loss of control of 
the cGAS-STING axis affects the development of neuroinflammation. Thus, we 
examined its role in major neurological diseases, including traumatic brain 
injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple 
sclerosis, herpes simplex encephalitis, and ataxia-telangiectasia. Additionally, 
targeted intervention of the cGAS-STING axis to control neuroinflammation and 
treat related diseases has become the focus of current clinical research. This 
article describes the development of cGAS inhibitors and small molecules that 
target the cGAS-STING axis and explores the potential applications of STING 
inhibitors and agonists in clinical research. In summary, the cGAS-STING axis 
may impact neurological diseases more than a single protein or gene. Future 
studies should focus on elucidating the functional dynamics and regulatory 
networks of this axis and delineating its crosstalk with other signaling 
cascades. These investigations will provide mechanistic insights for developing 
targeted therapeutic strategies for associated disorders and potentially 
facilitate drug repurposing across diverse disease contexts.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder, characterized by progressive motor and cognitive decline, leading to 
long-term disability and significantly impacting quality of life. While PD 
research has traditionally focused on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra (SN), emerging evidence also suggests glial involvement in disease 
progression. So, this study explored PD-associated key genes from neuronal and 
glial cell types to uncover pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutics 
by employing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from the accession 
number GSE184950. A total of 426,886 nuclei were analyzed, yielding 129,473 
high-quality nuclei. Through rigorous quality control, clustering, and marker 
gene analysis using scVI and Scanpy, nine distinct cell types were delineated, 
including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. 18 common differentially expressed 
genes (cDEGs) were identified across neuronal and glial cell types. Gene 
ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed key terms associated with 
neurodegeneration, including PD. A total of six critical KGs, including HSPA1A, 
DNAJB1, BAG3, SYN1, CALB2, and NEFL, along with their key regulators, were 
identified by the protein-protein interaction network. Finally, three repurposed 
drugs (Celastrol, Withaferin-A, and Apomorphine) were suggested as the 
therapeutics agents for PD by molecular docking. In-silico ADME/T analyses were 
conducted using pkCSM and SwissADME to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties 
of these compounds. These findings could shed light on PD mechanisms and hold 
promise for advancing diagnostics and therapies.

Here, we briefly discuss 17 PCT patent applications related to drug repurposing 
that were published during the final quarter of 2024. As always, we have chosen 
the documents based on significance only, which gave us a wide range of 
applicants, active agents, and geographic representation. Applicants are not 
only from the United States and China but also from Japan, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, Canada, and even remote places such as Algeria and Iceland. 
Significantly, the contribution from Iceland is how to induce therapeutic 
hypothermia-but with entacapone, used in Parkinson's disease. The UK company, 
HealX, presents data showing that Angelman syndrome, an intractable 
neurodevelopmental disorder, could be treated with the common NSAID sulindac. 
Gliclazide, an old antidiabetic, could potentially treat schizophrenia, as 
inventors from Chinese Ping An-Shionogi report. These are only a few highlights 
from the stream of documents that have been issued towards the end of 2024.

A Hierarchical Attention-based Negative Sampling Method for Drug Repositioning 
Using Neighborhood Interaction Fusion.

Mi C, Dai L, Shang J, Zhu R, Wang J, Li F.

Accurate prediction of drug-disease associations (DDAs) is essential for drug 
repositioning and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, 
existing methods often suffer from limited prior knowledge and the use of 
oversimplified negative sampling techniques, which hinder their ability to 
capture the complex relationships between drugs and diseases. To break through 
these limitations, we propose a new model, Hierarchical Attention 
Mechanism-Based Negative Sampling (HA-NegS), which aims to enhance the 
prediction of potential DDAs. In this study, HA-NegS further computes the 
similarity information between drugs and diseases and constructs heterogeneous 
and homogeneous networks based on it. For the similarity network, HA-NegS fuses 
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to 
effectively capture the neighborhood features of the target nodes. Subsequently, 
the model incorporates a hierarchical sampling strategy using the PageRank 
algorithm to rank nodes in descending order of global importance. The attention 
mechanism is then used to calculate the attention score and re-rank the nodes 
accordingly. This approach ensures the reliability of the negative sample 
selection. In order to obtain optimized representations, we use graph 
contrastive learning methods to refine drug and disease features with 
homogeneous and heterogeneous neighborhood information. Experimental results on 
a benchmark dataset show that HA-NegS outperforms existing baseline methods in 
predicting DDA. In addition, case studies for Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease highlight the effectiveness of HA-NegS in discovering new 
therapeutic applications for existing drugs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There are currently no treatments that can halt or 
slow the progression of Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this study was to 
identify new drug repurposing candidates for PD among existing prescription 
drugs that could be used to modify the disease course.
METHODS: This nationwide observational cohort study (2004-2020) used Norwegian 
health registries and was conducted as a high-throughput drug screen using an 
emulated target trial design. All individuals who met our prescription-based 
classification criteria for PD, were older than 25 years at the time of 
diagnosis, and were not prescribed the target drug in the past 2 years were 
included. We emulated a target trial for any drug filled by a minimum of 100 
individuals at any pharmacy in Norway, which amounted to a total of 219 drugs. 
Mortality was used as an outcome to indicate disease progression. We estimated 
the effect of drug initiation, an observational analog of the intention-to-treat 
effect, on the 8-year risk of death, comparing initiators of the target drug 
with initiators of drugs within the same Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
classification system level 1 group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting 
was used to adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: The study included 14,289 individuals with PD (mean age 72 at 
diagnosis, 59% male) and identified 23 drugs associated with reduced mortality 
risk at 8 years. These drugs included ranitidine (histamine-2 blocker); 
pantoprazole and esomeprazole (proton pump inhibitors); losartan (angiotensin 
receptor blocker); atorvastatin (for high cholesterol); tadalafil (for erectile 
dysfunction); levothyroxine sodium (thyroid hormone); phenoxymethylpenicillin, 
erythromycin, and azithromycin (antibiotics); 4 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs; combined codeine/paracetamol and tramadol (opioid analgesics); zopiclone 
and melatonin (sleep aids); mianserin (antidepressant); mometasone (nasal 
corticosteroid); 2 opium-derived cough medicines; and dexamethasone 
(ophthalmologic corticosteroid).
DISCUSSION: Our study identified several drugs with potential disease-modifying 
properties that could be candidates for future clinical trials. It highlights 
the potential of repurposing existing medications to advance drug development. 
While these findings are exploratory and, therefore, insufficient to justify 
immediate clinical application, they warrant further investigation and potential 
inclusion in clinical trials.

Stroke, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is a major cause of 
functional disability. Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, 
the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors 
(A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders 
involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR 
antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy 
and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the 
role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains 
unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced 
post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following 
the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the 
potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats 
subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. 
Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) 
following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented 
anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, 
istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment 
and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal 
neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-α, nNOS, and iNOS levels after 
PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β1 and 
IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and 
that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug 
repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.

Drug repurposing has emerged as a cost-efficient strategy for neurodegenerative 
disorders (NDDs), leveraging existing preclinical, safety, and tolerability data 
to identify therapeutic candidates. NDDs, including epilepsy, Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI), are 
characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal degeneration, 
with key signaling pathways such as HMGB1, TRPA1, NF-κB, MAPK, and 
PI3K/Akt-GSK3β playing pivotal roles in their pathogenesis. Given the 
established link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and neurodegeneration, 
Saroglitazar, a dual PPAR-α/γ agonist, holds promise in modulating insulin 
signaling, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and key pathways, including 
HMGB1, TRPA1, NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt-GSK3β. This is the first comprehensive 
review to examine the effects of Saroglitazar in modulating multiple pathways 
associated with NDDs, thereby addressing existing gaps in the literature. The 
review explores the mechanistic interplay among these pathways and emphasizes 
the potential of Saroglitazar as a neuroprotective agent, highlighting the need 
for further studies to validate its clinical efficacy and disease-modifying 
capabilities in NDDs. All supporting data were obtained from peer-reviewed 
literature accessed via PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with 
growing prevalence worldwide and, as yet, no effective treatment. Drug 
repurposing is invaluable for detecting novel PD therapeutics. Here, we compiled 
gene expression data from 1231 healthy human brain samples and 357 samples 
across tissues, ethnicities, brain regions, Braak stages, and disease status. By 
integrating them with multiple-source genomic data, we found a PD-associated 
gene co-expression module, and its alignment with the CMAP database successfully 
identified drug candidates. Among these, meclofenoxate hydrochloride (MH) and 
sodium phenylbutyrate (SP) are indicated to be able to prevent mitochondrial 
destruction, reduce lipid peroxidation, and protect dopamine synthesis. MH was 
validated to prevent neuronal death and synaptic damage, improve motor function, 
and reduce anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors of PD mice. The interaction 
of MH with a PD-related protein, sigma1, was confirmed experimentally. Thus, our 
findings support that MH potentially ameliorates PD by interacting with sigma1.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurologic condition for 
which symptomatic, but not preventative, treatment is available. Drug 
repurposing is an innovate drug discovery method that uncovers existing 
therapeutics to treat or prevent conditions for which they are not currently 
indicated, a method that could be applied to incurable diseases such as PD. A 
knowledge graph artificial intelligence prediction system was used to select 
potential drugs that could be used to treat or prevent PD, and amphetamine was 
identified as the strongest candidate. Retrospective cohort analysis on a large, 
electronic health record database of deidentified patients with attention 
deficit hyperactive disorder (the main diagnosis for which amphetamine is 
prescribed) revealed a significantly reduced hazard of developing PD in patients 
prescribed amphetamine versus patients not prescribed amphetamine at 2, 4, and 6 
years: Hazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval) = 0.59 (0.36, 0.98), 0.63 (0.42, 
0.93), and 0.55 (0.38, 0.79). Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that 
amphetamine targets many of the biochemical processes implicated in PD, such as 
dopaminergic synapses and neurodegeneration. Together, these observational 
findings suggest that therapeutic and legal amphetamine use may reduce the risk 
of developing PD, in contrast to previous work that found the inverse 
relationship in patients using amphetamine recreationally.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder lacking 
effective disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we integrated large-scale 
protein-protein interaction networks with a multi-modal graph neural network 
(GNN) to identify and prioritize multi-target drug repurposing candidates for 
PD. Network analysis and advanced clustering methods delineated functional 
modules, and a novel Functional Centrality Index was employed to pinpoint key 
nodes within the PD interactome. The GNN model, incorporating molecular 
descriptors, network topology, and uncertainty quantification, predicted 
candidate drugs that simultaneously target critical proteins implicated in 
lysosomal dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, synaptic disruption, and 
neuroinflammation. Among the top hits were compounds such as dithiazanine, 
ceftolozane, DL-α-tocopherol, bromisoval, imidurea, medronic acid, and 
modufolin. These findings provide mechanistic insights into PD pathology and 
demonstrate that a polypharmacology approach can reveal repurposing 
opportunities for existing drugs. Our results highlight the potential of 
network-based deep learning frameworks to accelerate the discovery of 
multi-target therapies for PD and other multifactorial neurodegenerative 
diseases.
